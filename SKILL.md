## Save the Log

1. Get today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format (run `date +%Y-%m-%d` via Bash).
2. Create the `notes/` directory in the current working directory if it does not exist.
3. Write the file to `notes/daily-log-YYYY-MM-DD.md` with this format:

```markdown
# Daily Log — YYYY-MM-DD

## Vitals
- Energy: X/10
- Focus: X/10
- Mood: X/10

## Highlight
[their answer]

## Blocker
[their answer]

## Tomorrow
[their answer]

---
*Logged via /daily-log*
```

## After Saving

Print a one-line confirmation:

> Logged! Energy X, Focus X, Mood X. See you tomorrow.

If an `achievements.md` file exists in the current directory, update it:
- Count `notes/daily-log-*.md` files to update streak and check achievement unlocks (First Log, Consistency, Week Warrior, Fortnight Force).
- Add an entry to the Activity Log table.

## Auto-Enrich: Pattern Analysis (every 3rd log)

After saving, count all `notes/daily-log-*.md` files. If the count is divisible by 3 (3, 6, 9, 12...):

1. Read ALL daily-log files in `notes/`
2. Read `user-profile.md` (if it exists)
3. Analyze patterns across all logs:
   - Energy/focus/mood trends (which days are high/low?)
   - Recurring blockers (what themes keep appearing?)
   - Correlations (does high energy correlate with certain activities?)
   - Productivity windows (any time-of-week patterns?)
4. Add or update a `## Patterns From Daily Logs` section at the end of `user-profile.md`
5. Keep it concise — 5-8 bullet points max. Replace the previous version, don't append.
6. Tell the user: "Updated user-profile.md with patterns from X logs."

Example patterns section:
```markdown
## Patterns From Daily Logs
*Auto-updated from 9 daily logs*
- Energy peaks mid-week (Tue-Thu avg 8, Mon avg 5)
- Most common blocker: context-switching between projects
- Focus improves on days with a clear "one thing" from previous log
- Mood correlates strongly with getting the highlight task done
- Best productivity window: mornings before first meeting
```

## Optional: Group Share

After everything is saved, ask ONE final question:

- **Question:** "Share something with the course group?"
- **Options:** `["Share streak + vibe (e.g. 'Day 5. Energy 8.')", "Write a custom message", "Skip — keep it private"]`

If they choose to share:
1. Compose a short one-liner (streak count + vitals, or their custom text)
2. Show the exact message and ask for confirmation before doing anything
3. If confirmed, send it to the course Telegram group **"edu-ai-productivity-s2"** via MCP
4. If MCP is not connected or sending fails, just print the message and say "Copy this to the group chat when you're ready"

If they skip, move on silently.

Do NOT turn this into a long conversation. The whole interaction should take under 5 minutes.
